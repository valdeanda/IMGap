# MetaGaia: A tool for analyzing bin abundances and metabolic profiles

*Sahil B. Shah - sbs2756@utexas.edu, Valerie de Anda - valdeanda@utexas.edu*

MetaGaia is a pipeline that streamlines the process of calculating bin abundances, identifying the metabolic pathways present in each bin, and the metabolic pathways found in both phages and their hosts. The importance of performing each of these functions is to better understand microbial communities and the dominant microbes present within a community. This pipeline is divinding into three sections that perform different functions: 1) Calculating bin abundances (bin_abundance), 2) Identyfing metabolic pathways present in each bin (metabolism), and 3) Finding commonalities between phages and their hosts (phage-host_analysis).

The Gaia hypothesis, also known as Gaia theory or Gaia principle, proposes that all organisms and their inorganic surroundings on Earth are closely integrated to form a single and self-regulating complex system, maintaining the conditions for life on the planet
